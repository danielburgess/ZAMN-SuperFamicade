#SynWrite Lexer for SNES/SFC 65816c Assembly (I used with xkas 0.06)
I will be re-doing the lexer at some point, but right now here are the features:
- Keyword Highlighting
- Register address recognition (registers are identified and highlighted differently)
- Memory address highlighting
- Some XKAS preprocessor directives are highlighted
