# ZAMN Super Famicade Version
I'm working on a special hack for Zombies Ate My Neighbors, originally released in 1993 in the USA for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

## Here's what is implemented so far:
- High Score SRAM saving
- Game Over Blood Hack
- HUD is customized to show "Lives:#"
- HUD is moved to the bottom of the screen
- Support for P1 coin-up in-game
- Supports basic support for SRAM mapping for both LoROM and HiROM (if you want to convert the game to HiROM for whatever reason)

## What's next:
- Additional support for extra input for the SuperFamicade Controller Board
	(make support switchable - always on until other features are implemented)
	(SuperFamicade/SFC Controller Board project here: https://hackaday.io/project/3121-super-famicade)
- Graphical Changes for "Arcade Mode"
- Code Changes for "Arcade Mode" (Including options for difficulty, # lives per coin-up, etc.)
- Support second player join-in

## Note:
Removed Synwrite lexer. Will be moving to new repo.
