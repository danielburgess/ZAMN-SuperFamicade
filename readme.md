#ZAMN Super Famicade Version
I'm working on a special hack for Zombies Ate My Neighbors, originally released in 1993 in the USA for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Here's what is implemented so far:
- High Score SRAM saving
- Game Over Blood Hack
- HUD is customized to show "Lives:#"
- HUD is moved to the bottom of the screen

What's next:
- Support extra input for the SuperFamicade Controller Board
	(make support switchable - always on until other features are implemented)
	(SuperFamicade/SFC Controller Board project here: https://hackaday.io/project/3121-super-famicade)
- Graphical Changes for "Arcade Mode"
- Code Changes for "Arcade Mode" (May include options for difficulty, # lives per coin-up, etc.)
- Support second player join-in
